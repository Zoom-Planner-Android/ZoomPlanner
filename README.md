## Overview
### Description
This app will be a planner/organizer dedicated to organizing Zoom links in one location. 

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Productivity
- **Mobile:** Push notifications, 
- **Story:** Zoom isn't going away anytime soon, so the reception of a Zoom link organizer would appeal to our audience very well. Students and peers would find the usefulness in assuaging Zoom fatigue by removing a barrier to accessing Zoom links. 
- **Market:** Large size and scope. Audience is students, professionals, and anyone using Zoom recreationally. 
- **Habit:** The user can create events and populate their Zoom link organizer. The user will access the app multiple times a day depending on their needs. 
- **Scope:** The concept of the app is similar to a Calendar but using a Zoom API. The front-end part of the application should be easy to complete by the deadline. The back-end part of the application will make use of the Zoom API and populate the front-end with useful data.
